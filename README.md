#  COMPARISON AND CONTRAST OF POINT & CLICK, AUTOML AND PROGRAMMING TOOLS IN PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN IN TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY 
# Overview
The purpose of this project is to critically evaluate and assess analytics tools from the 3 different paradigms i.e. 1.) Point & Click (Rapidminer and SAS Viya), 2.)AutoML (DataRobot) and 3.) Programming (Python or R)
# Tasks
The task is to compare and contrast tools for the 3 different approaches based on experience of working 
with them to perform tasks at different stages of the data analytics pipeline. The basis for this can be work on 1.) a 
single dataset, 2.) a handful of datasets from a given area or 3.) datasets chosen to specifically highlight different facets
of each technology. 
NB: The academic license for SAS Viya does not facilitate uploading of data and DataRobot does not enable sharing of projects etc
